# Object detection using binary classification 

Developer : Dishan Nahitiya
Area : Computer science 

# Objective 

Develop a simple program to identify different object in images by using 

# What is lbp 

# History

# What is it used for

 - face recognition 
 - face detection 
 - verication purposed of the facial images
 - 


# Results and Discussion 
 Since the match is problem 
 - rotation was needed to identify the differences because the 
# Conclusion 

 - Hard to identify the intensties becuase of the spread
 - It was easy to identify the things
