# Object detection using Local Binary classification 

Developer : Dishan Nahitiya
Area      : Image analysis


# Objective

Develop an image classifier to identify the nearest class label of canopies based on thier texture intensitivity. 

#  Methodology

 There are number of image classification algorithm in the field of image analysis. I will make this project as a opportunity to explore about local binary pattern search , a basic image analysis method which is widely used in facial recognition, face detection and etc verication purposed of the facial images.   

# What is local binary pattern search ?

Local binary search is a texture based classification algorithm which generates a pattern sequence. This technique uses a 3 * 3 which traverse through all pixel and use threshholding arround the center pixel and generate a 8 bit number.LBP operator is then applied on the image to extract local features represented by histogram.

Inorder to identify the simlarities between histograms generated by image, the 
model needs a distant classifier. This project used the Kullback Leibler divergence 
which has the ability to identify the probability distributions in histograms.

Same level of probability distribution would like to have similar kind texture features
which could lead similar propertise in its pictures.

# Challanges
  When in analysing images , due to various reason such as noise, brigghness, shape difference, orientation difference and etc, the models were
  not able to identify same texture spreads in histograms. Solution for this was reprocess the images using data augmentation algorithms. 
  This would give the ability to create different senario of each image and identify the texture similarities in the pictures.

# Results and Discussion 
 - Since the match is problem 
 - rotation was needed to identify the differences because the 
 - since  Kullback Leibler divergence is not a high end distant classifier it has the ability to produce false output.
   inorder get a proper classification it better use a classifier such as support vector machines, k-means and etc. 
   Moreover in modern day deep nural networks has the ability to identify the reagion
 
# Conclusion 

 - Hard to identify the intensties becuase of unorthodox shapes of each plants.
 - Large data set is needed to optimizer  
 - It was easy to identify the things
